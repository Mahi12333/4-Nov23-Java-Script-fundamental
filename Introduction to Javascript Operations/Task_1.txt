1)Expressiveness Oparetor:-
let sum = 5 + 3; // Instead of using a function or complex syntax
2)Variable Assignment:-
Assignment operators (=, +=, -=) are used to assign values to variables.
 This is a fundamental concept in programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data efficiently.
 let x = 10; // Assigning a value to a variable
3)Logical Operations:-
Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are crucial for making decisions in code. 
They are commonly used in conditions and loops to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
if (x > 0 && y > 0) {
  // Code to execute if both conditions are true
}
4)Comparison and Relational Operations:-
Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) are used to compare values, 
making it possible to create conditions and make decisions based on the result of these comparisons.
if (a === b) {
  // Code to execute if a is equal to b
}
5)Bitwise Operations (Advanced):-
Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) allow manipulation of individual bits in binary representations of numbers. 
let result = a & b; // Bitwise AND operation

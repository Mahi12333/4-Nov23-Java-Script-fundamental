In JavaScript, primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data and are immutable, 
meaning they cannot be altered once created. 
There are five primitive data types in JavaScript:-
1)String:-
let myString = 'Hello, World!';
2)Number:-
let myNumber = 42;
let myFloat = 3.14;
3)Boolean:-
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;
4)Null:-
let myNull = null;
5)Undefine:-
let myUndefined;

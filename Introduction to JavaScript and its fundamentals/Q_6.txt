Readability: Clear and descriptive variable names make code more readable, reducing the cognitive load for developers trying to understand the purpose of each variable.

Understanding: Meaningful names provide context and convey the purpose of the variable, making it easier for developers to grasp the intent and functionality of the code.

Maintenance: When you or others revisit the code for maintenance or updates, meaningful variable names help quickly identify the role of each variable, reducing the likelihood of introducing errors.

Collaboration: In a collaborative coding environment, descriptive variable names facilitate communication among team members by making the codebase more accessible and understandable.

Documentation: Well-named variables serve as a form of documentation within the code itself, reducing the need for excessive comments to explain the purpose of each variable.
